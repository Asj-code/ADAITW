# ADAITW

## This is the first project of the Python Intensive course by ADAITW.
The objective is to develop the interactive game "guess the word".
The expected performance is as follows:
When executing the program, a hidden word will be displayed on the screen using as many hyphens
as letters contains the word to guess (the word to guess will be chosen by the
program using the Python module random), the number of lives the player has
player and the amount of incorrect letters that he is entering.
When the player enters a letter, it is necessary that the data be validated (that it be a letter).
After validating the entered letter, it is verified if the entered letter belongs to any of the
the letters of the word to guess.
Every time the player enters a letter that does NOT belong to the word to be guessed,
one life will remain.
The game ends when the player runs out of lives or guesses all the letters in the
word. In all cases, a message should be displayed indicating whether the game was won or whether
lost.
